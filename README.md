React is mostly used for creating Single Page Applications. But itâ€™s possible to integrate the library into any website by using Webpack and Babel.


Features

    Simple src/index.jsx and src/index.css (local module css).
    Webpack configuration for development (with hot reloading) and production (with minification).
    CSS module loading, so you can include your css by import styles from './path/to.css';.
    Both js(x) and css hot loaded during development.
